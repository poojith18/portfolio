    title: "Self Driving Toy Car",
    description: "At the Design Innovation Center (DIC), IIT Bhubaneswar, I was involved in the development of a Raspberry Pi-based self-driving toy car. The car was designed to have autonomous driving capabilities using deep neural networks. To facilitate communication between the hardware components and the deep learning-based auto-pilot, I utilized the Robotic Operating System (ROS) as a middleware suite.",

    title: "Face Recognition web application",
    description: "I developed a Face Recognition web application using machine learning, OpenCV, and the Flask framework. The application was built entirely from scratch, involving the development of a web server gateway interface in Flask. I utilized HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to design and style the frontend of the application. On the backend, I wrote the necessary Python code and seamlessly integrated the machine learning model into the Flask application. This resulted in a functional web application capable of performing face recognition tasks.",

    title: "Timetable Management System",
    description: "I developed an administrator portal that simplifies the management of various information related to Timetable, Faculty, Student, Subject, and classroom availability. The portal offers a range of functionalities, including searching, editing, and filtering based on criteria such as Faculty and classroom. Additionally, it generates semester-wise timetable reports for Faculty and Students, which can be conveniently exported to different formats like PDF and CSV.",
